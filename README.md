This assignment is quite confusing as it is left open ended in a lot of things, but for now here is the website - created through github, as that was one of the options in the linkedin learning.


As far as I am aware the website was the main requirement, and I have messed around with a bit of HTML and CSS. This is all quite confusing, but I found this to work.
